Here you can see several buttons:
1. **open image file** - Button to load DICOM images.
2. **Annotate** - After pressing this button, you can make annotations on the image using the left mouse button. To annotate, click, hold, and then release the button. If you are satisfied with the annotation, you need to confirm it by pressing + on the keyboard. If you do not confirm, the last annotation will be automatically deleted.
3. At the top of the screen, there are buttons to zoom in on the image using a magnifier. This button works similarly to the annotator. After each use, it is necessary to turn off this tool by clicking on it again. The home button returns the image to its original size.
4. After completing the annotations on the selected image, you need to save them all to a separate file using the **save annotations** button.

Checking and Saving the Annotations File: After completing the previous steps, you can check if the annotations were saved to the file. After clicking on save annotations, a file named <loaded_file_name>_<image_number>_annotations.txt will be automatically created. The name of the file will match the name of the loaded file, along with the image number from the series. This file will always be saved in the same location from which the data was loaded using the open image file button.
